    <div class='text-large text-left pb-2 text-gray-300'>Mining</div>
    <div class='text-small text-white pb-4'>
    Each time the red progress bar fills up, gain gems and have a chance for additional drops. <br /> Use your currencies on upgrades to your mining rig.
    </div>

    <div class='text-large text-left pb-2 text-gray-300'>Keys</div>
    <div class='text-small text-white pb-4'>
        Use your found keys here! You unlock more information on drops after receiving at least one of the respective item from the respective key.
        <br /> Slurry (unlocked later) - Break down your keys into slurry. With the help of mysterious sigils, you can craft some of the most powerful items in the game (assuming you have already obtained at least one of that item).
    </div>

    <div class='text-large text-left pb-2 text-gray-300'>Beacons</div>
    <div class='text-small text-white pb-4'>
    Allocate beacons into paths, leveling them up over time and gaining bonuses. Each color tier requires drastically more power than the previous one, so you'll need to work up to the later paths. 
    <br />You gain beacon power based on your beacon levels. Beacon power can augment your beacon paths.
    </div>

    <div class='text-large text-left pb-2 text-gray-300'>Enchants</div>
    <div class='text-small text-white pb-4'>
    Mine size and Mine quality affect many things, not just enchants! Make sure to check tooltips. 
    <br />When the enchant bar of each respective color fills, there's a chance for all enchants of the same color as the bar to fire (chance shown on tooltips), giving a very powerful bonus. Upgrade your enchants to increase the proc chance.
    </div>

    <div class='text-large text-left pb-2 text-gray-300'>Relocate</div>
    <div class='text-small text-white pb-4'>
    Reset to gain fame. Fame can be spent on powerful mining upgrades and enchants. It's recommended for your first relocation to gain at least 25 fame, which should take about 1-2 hours. 
    <br />HINT: Are you stuck? Each fame multiplier is color-coded based on the resource it deals with. If you are struggling to increase fame gains, you may be able to increase a specific multiplier by checking the tab where that resource is generated/used.
    </div>

    <div class='text-large text-left pb-2 text-gray-300'>Button</div>
    <div class='text-small text-white pb-4'>
        Click the button to gain crystals, which are used in a variety of upgrades. The center of the button gives better rewards, but you'll have to be precise.
    </div>

    <div class='text-large text-left pb-2 text-gray-300'>Notes</div>
    <div class='text-small text-white pb-4'>
        This game is balanced around playing manually without the use of any tools. Most things are automatic by default, and the mechanics that require active play do it for a reason, and/or can be automated in a reasonable time.
        <br /> You are free to play however you want, but using autoclickers/scripts will likely ruin some of the experience of the game.
